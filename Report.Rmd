library(caret)
library(class)
library(janitor)
library(kernlab)

```

## Load Data

```{r}
future::plan("multisession")
pbp <- load_pbp(2010:2020, file_type = "qs")
str(pbp)
```

## Set up "Going For It" (GFI) Data
```{r}
# Only pull plays that are a fourth down attempt
GFI <- pbp[!is.na(pbp$play_type), ]
GFI <- GFI[!is.na(GFI$play_id) & GFI$down == 4 & GFI$punt_attempt == 0 & GFI$field_goal_attempt == 0 & GFI$play_type != "no_play" & GFI$play_type != "qb_kneel", ]
```

## Set up GFI data for all models
```{r}
# Using model.matrix to convert all the factors to dummy variables
# We are converting all of the factors into dummy variables as the input into knn has to be numeric

# Include all variables for step function, exclude NA rows
GFI_ALL <- GFI[!is.na(GFI$fourth_down_converted), ]

## Randomize the rows in the data (shuffling the rows)
set.seed(123)
GFI_ALL <- slice(GFI_ALL, sample(1:n()))
```


# Variable Selection with GLM

## Training
```{r}
GFI_GLM_ALL <- select(
  GFI_ALL,
  fourth_down_converted,

)
GFI_GLM_ALL <- GFI_GLM_ALL %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)

GFI_GLM_ALL <- GFI_GLM_ALL %>% select(where(~ n_distinct(.) > 1))

train_set <- sample(1:nrow(GFI_GLM_ALL), 0.7 * nrow(GFI_GLM_ALL))

# Training set
gfi_glm_train <- GFI_GLM_ALL[train_set, ]
gfi_glm_validation <- GFI_GLM_ALL[-train_set, ]

model_glm <- glm(fourth_down_converted ~ ., data = gfi_glm_train, family = "binomial", control = list(maxit = 100))
model_glm <- step(model_glm, direction = "backward", trace = 0)
summary(model_glm)
```

## Predicting
```{r}
predict_glm <- predict(model_glm, newdata = gfi_glm_validation, type = "response")
predict_glm_factor <- ifelse(predict_glm < 0.5, 0, 1)
predict_glm_factor <- as.factor(predict_glm_factor)
confusionMatrix(predict_glm_factor, as.factor(gfi_glm_validation$fourth_down_converted))
```

Now we will run future models on just inputs the stepwise GLM found significant.

```{r}
# Include only variables we want to use in prediction

  timeout,
  posteam_score,
  defteam_score,
  away_score,
  home_score
)

GFI_small <- GFI_small %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)

GFI_small <- GFI_small %>% select(where(~ n_distinct(.) > 1))

GFI_small <- clean_names(GFI_small)

# Model Matrix for ANN
GFI_mm <- as.data.frame(model.matrix(~ . - 1, GFI_small))


# Normalize the data

# Decision Predictions

(Jim Harbaugh and Dan Campbell please read this part)

We will now create a function that uses the trained model to determine if a team should "Go For It" on 4th Down.

## Stacked Logistic Model
First, we want a stacked model that outputs a probability, and not a binary response. We will use a logistic stacked model instead of a decision tree. KNN will not be used because it is hard to form a lightweight function.

### Training
```{r, cache=TRUE}
stacked_glm <- glm(GFI_labels ~ . - knn, data = train_data)
stacked_glm <- step(stacked_glm, direction = "backward")
summary(stacked_glm)
```

As it turns out, the ann is also not that useful per the stacked glm, so it can be omitted from the function we create too.

## Decision Function

Now we will define the actual decision function. The function requires as input a data frame with the following fields:

yardline_100, half_seconds_remaining, game_half, goal_to_go, ydstogo, play_type, shotgun, timeout, posteam_score, defteam_score, away_score, home_score, season, home_team, posteam, roof, down, posteam_timeouts_remaining, defteam_timeouts_remaining

It requires the following models:

ann_model, svm_model, glm_model, tree_model, stacked_glm

```{r}
gfi <- function(df, stacked_glm, svm_model, tree, glm_model, oppteam) {
  df$game_half <- factor(df$game_half, levels(GFI_small$game_half))
  df$play_type <- factor(df$play_type, levels(GFI_small$play_type))

  model_outs <- data.frame(
    "glm" = predict(glm_model, newdata = df),
    "svm" = predict(svm_model, df),
    "tree" = predict(tree, df)
  )

  glm_logit <- predict(stacked_glm, model_outs)

  logit2prob <- function(logit) {
    odds <- exp(logit)
    prob <- odds / (1 + odds)
    return(prob)
  }

  prob_success <- logit2prob(glm_logit)

  pos_df <- df
  pos_df$down <- 1
  pos_df$ydstogo <- 10
  pos_df$yardline_100 <- pos_df$yardline_100 - pos_df$ydstogo

  success <- nflfastR::calculate_expected_points(pos_df) %>%
    dplyr::select(ep)

  opp_df <- df
  opp_df$posteam <- oppteam
  opp_df$down <- 1
  opp_df$ydstogo <- 10
  opp_df$yardline_100 <- 100 - pos_df$yardline_100

  failure <- nflfastR::calculate_expected_points(opp_df) %>%
    dplyr::select(ep)

  exp_net_pts <- prob_success * success$ep + (1 - prob_success) * failure$ep * -1

  tab <- matrix(c(ifelse(exp_net_pts > 0, "Go For It", "Don't Go For It"), prob_success, success, failure, exp_net_pts), ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
  colnames(tab) <- c("Go For It?", "Probability of Success", "Exp. Points if Success", "Exp. Points if Fail", "Exp. Net Points")
  return(tab)
}
```

Now that the function has been defined we will create a variety of scenarios and apply the function to them.

# Acknowledged Issues and Next Steps

Taking a step back after building our initial model, we found it important to recognize the current flaws we have in our model. Since we built and trained our model solely on plays where a fourth down conversion was attempted, selection bias is present, and our training dataset was relatively small in comparison to the complete NFL Play-By-Play dataset we began with. Our training set was especially reduced since fourth down conversions are relatively unlikely in comparison to other plays. 

Additionally due to the time constraints of this class project, we were not able to include other fourth down play decisions in our training dataset or decision space. These alternative play decisions would be punting the ball away, or attempting a field goal. Adding these plays would reduce our selection bias, and would expand our decision space to advise a coach on what play to call if a fourth down conversion is unlikely to be a success.

Furthermore, expanding our decision space in a future model would likely change our analysis on when a fourth down conversion attempt would be successful. Specifically, many of the scenarios in which our model would tell a team to go for the fourth down, would likely change to suggest kicking a field goal would be the most successful play. Since our current model uses expected points as a way of quantifying success, kicking a field goal would be more successful than a fourth down conversion (when a team is in range of a field goal) since it would have higher expected points. 

In general, we would prioritize expanding our model’s decision space in the next steps, since this would offer more dynamic advice to coaches about what play to run.
